                        strong passion for computer science. From web design to AI and machine learning,
                        programming is one of my favorite pastimes. I'm always eager to apply my skills
                        to assist the community, particularly the younger as well as the older generation. As I discovered my
                        love for coding at a young age, I aspire to inspire senior citizens and children to develop an
                        interest in programming as well. Together with Tanvi, our goal is to encourage
                        the Mainline's youth and elderly to pursue programming, and we believe that CS4Mainline is
                        the ideal platform to achieve this.

                    Hi! My name is Tanvi B., and I am a current junior living alongside the Philadelphia Mainline. My passions lie in the intersections of Cognitive Science and Business.
                    Ever since I waslittle, I was interested in all things tech-related. From unboxing the latest
                    iPhone to coding in Scratch, I wanted to share my interest in coding with other
                    kids for free and at no-cost. That’s why Sowmya and I kickstarted CS4Mainline, a non-profit originally started by my
                    brother. I wanted the kids and the elderly of our generation to get hands-on experience in coding and cybersecurity,
                    with the ability to be able to share their passions and ideas!

                    My name is Shubham Gumma. Since I was 11 years old, I have had an interest in coding due to the innovation and creativity involved. During COVID-19, I learned JavaScript for 2 years which was primarily game based. In addition, I picked up some basic HTML and CSS skills which would be useful for website creation. As a started my high school career, I began my Freshman year by taking AP Computer Science Principles and continued coding my sophomore year by taking AP Computer Science A. In addition, being on the leadership team for our local Computers for Kids Club, I have some background on the cybersecurity risks involved with internet fishing and scamming. I am ready to reach out to others to help share my knowledge and keep the coding spark going!

Furthermore, learning more about cybersecurity growing up became something that I became greatly interested in, which is why I’m so excited to mentor and share the knowledge and the importance of cybersecurity to the community around me through our Cybersecurity program in CS4Mainline! I truly believe that everyone deserves to know how to be safe online, and I believe that through our programs in CS4Mainline, our local community can earn and maintain the necessary skills to achieve this!
