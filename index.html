                   The Basic Coding Program is a free 10-week program covering basic coding skills starting from  Scratch and block-coding to bits of HTML,
                    CSS, as well as introductory Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. First, students will be learning small projects using the Google 
                    CSFIRST © curriculum. Once they have a general understanding of block-coding, they will learn website design using aspects of HTML
                    and CSS. Students will get a hands-on experience in the web development realm. Lastly, students will learn about Artificial Intelligence,
                    the future and dangers of AI, as well as how to utilize AI as a tool.

                        Hello! I'm Sowmya K,, a current junior residing in the Philadelphia Mainline, with a
                        strong passion for computer science. From web design to AI and machine learning,
                        programming is one of my favorite pastimes. I'm always eager to apply my skills
                        to assist the community, particularly the younger as well as the older generation. As I discovered my
                        love for coding at a young age, I aspire to inspire senior citizens and children to develop an
                        interest in programming as well. Together with Tanvi, our goal is to encourage
                        the Mainline's youth and elderly to pursue programming, and we believe that CS4Mainline is
                        the ideal platform to achieve this.

                    Hi! My name is Tanvi B., and I am a current junior living alongside the Philadelphia Mainline. My passions lie in the intersections of Cognitive Science and Business.
                    Ever since I waslittle, I was interested in all things tech-related. From unboxing the latest
                    iPhone to coding in Scratch, I wanted to share my interest in coding with other
                    kids for free and at no-cost. That’s why Sowmya and I kickstarted CS4Mainline, a non-profit originally started by my
                    brother. I wanted the kids and the elderly of our generation to get hands-on experience in coding and cybersecurity,

                    iPhone to coding in Scratch, I wanted to share my interest in coding with other
                    kids for free and at no-cost. That’s why Sowmya and I kickstarted CS4Mainline, a non-profit originally started by my
                    brother. I wanted the kids and the elderly of our generation to get hands-on experience in coding and cybersecurity,
                    with the ability to be able to share their passions and ideas!

                    Hi! My name is Tanvi B., and I am a current junior living alongside the Philadelphia Mainline. My passions lie in the intersections of Cognitive Science and Business.
                    Ever since I waslittle, I was interested in all things tech-related. From unboxing the latest
                    iPhone to coding in Scratch, I wanted to share my interest in coding with other
                    kids for free and at no-cost. That’s why Sowmya and I kickstarted CS4Mainline, a non-profit originally started by my
